name: nika-debugging
description: Diagnose and repair failed, paused or suspicious Nika runs from their traces (.nika/traces). Use when nika run exited red, a run paused on a prompt, a NIKA-XXXX runtime finding needs a root cause, a trace must be read or tamper-verified, or a fixed workflow needs a surgical partial rerun.

# Debugging Nika runs

Every run writes a hash-chained journal to `.nika/traces/`. That journal
is the ONLY truth about what happened — debug from the trace, never from
a memory of the terminal scroll.

## The forensic loop (evidence first)

0. **A failed run already names its trace**: the card's `autopsy:`
   line carries the FULL trace path — start there when you have it.
1. **Locate the run**: `nika trace ls` — age · size · workflow ·
   terminal state (completed/failed/paused) · `★` marks the newest
   trace of each workflow (the resume candidate). Address a trace by
   its store path — `.nika/traces/<name>` — everywhere below (`ls`
   prints bare names; the readers take the path form on every
   version).
2. **Read the card**: `nika trace show <trace>` — the final verdict,
   the waves, per-task outcome. `nika trace replay <trace>` re-renders
   the run live (replay = re-render, NEVER re-execute).
3. **Find the failing task**: `nika trace outputs <trace>` — verb ·
   duration · tokens · a bounded preview per task (full value:
   `nika trace peek`). The first red task is the root; everything
   downstream is fallout.
4. **Decode the finding**: `nika explain NIKA-XXXX` teaches the cause ·
   category · fix-form of any code the trace carries.
5. **Re-audit the file**: `nika check <file>` — a run that failed often
   fails again at check once you know what to look for (a model that no
   longer resolves, a missing env var, a permits violation).
6. **Fix minimally, rerun surgically** (below). Re-check before any
   rerun.

## Prompts and confirm gates (paused OR failed — same answer line)

At a terminal, `nika:prompt` asks the human directly and the run
continues. Headless — which is where an agent lives — a prompt
without a `default:` **pauses durably** (exit 4 · `workflow_paused`
in the trace · never a failure frame) and the frame prints its exact
resume line. Three ways to answer, all recorded tamper-evident the same way:

```
nika run <file> --answer <task>=<value>                    # pre-answer at launch
nika run <file> --resume <trace> --answer <task>=<value>   # resume the pause
args: { …, default: <value> }                              # unattended default
```

Confirm gates take booleans (`--answer approve=true`); every task the
journal already proved is skipped as a visible cache hit, so only the
prompt and its downstream run. Removing a paused trace refuses
without `--force` and names the prompt it would destroy — that
refusal is protecting an answer, not being difficult. (Traces
recorded by 0.106.x and earlier can still show a
`NIKA-BUILTIN-PROMPT-001` failure — same repair line.)

A failed run's card prints its own forensics line (`autopsy:
nika trace peek <trace> <task>`) — start there, it points at the
exact failing task.

## Surgical reruns (never restart what already worked)

- `nika run <file> --from <task-id>` — rerun from one task onward,
  keeping upstream results.
- `nika run <file> --task <task-id>` — rerun exactly one task.
- After an intentional behavior change, refresh the pin:
  `nika test <file> --update` rewrites the golden from an offline mock
  run — never hand-edit a `.golden.json` to make red green.

## Common root causes (check these before anything exotic)

- **Model does not resolve**: `nika check <file> --json` →
  `models_resolve` says whether every `model:` runs in THIS binary;
  `nika catalog` names the env var each provider needs.
- **Missing credential**: secrets ride `${{ secrets.X }}`, declared in
  the `secrets:` block (`source: env` + `key:`) — the trace shows the
  task, the shell shows the variable. `nika doctor` audits the machine
  side. Non-sensitive settings ride an `inputs:` entry with
  `required: false` and a `default:`.
- **Timeout too tight**: local providers need `timeout: "300s"` or
  more — thinking models routinely think past 30s.
- **Permits violation**: the run was blocked by its own declared
  boundary — read the finding, then either the task is wrong or the
  boundary is (widen it consciously, never delete it). Every permit
  decision is recorded in the journal, GRANTED and REFUSED alike, so
  the trace names the exact boundary the run actually rode — read it
  there instead of guessing. A workflow with NO `permits:` block has
  zero authority (`NIKA-AUTH-006`), and check refuses it before the
  run ever starts.
- **A child process cannot see a variable**: the environment is
  composed from a cleared slate, so an unnamed variable simply is not
  there. Name it in `permits: { env: [NAME] }` or in the task's own
  `env:` map.
- **Cost cap hit**: `--max-cost-usd` blocks BEFORE the call that would
  cross the cap — that is the feature working, not a bug. Raise the
  cap deliberately or shrink the task.

## Tamper evidence

`nika trace verify <trace>` checks the hash chain: any edited,
inserted, dropped or reordered line breaks every hash after it.
Exit 0 intact · 2 broken · 3 unchained (pre-chain journal). The
verdict also names the highest tier honestly attained — chain OK ·
**SEALED** (the `run_sealed` signature verifies against a custody
key) · **ANCHORED** (the detached sidecar verifies fully offline) ·
**REPLAYED** (`--replay` compares a fresh run; verify never
re-executes). A journal that never reached a lifecycle-terminal frame
verifies **INCOMPLETE**: the verifier's finding about a run that died
mid-flight — not a pass, and not a tamper claim. Say which one you
have. Cite the trace in any report — a verified chain is proof, prose
is not; `nika trace evidence <trace>` exports the pack an auditor reads
without trusting you.

## Honesty lines

- The trace tells you what the engine did. It cannot tell you WHY a
  provider returned garbage — a provider-side outage or a model
  regression is named as a hypothesis, never asserted as fact.
- Never edit a trace. Never delete a paused trace to "clean up".
- If the binary is missing: `brew install supernovae-st/tap/nika` —
  do not reconstruct runs from memory.
