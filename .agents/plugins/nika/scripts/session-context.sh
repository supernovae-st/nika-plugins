# session-context — the omniscience seed: when a session opens in a
# workspace that uses Nika, hand the agent the map once, up front —
# which surfaces exist (MCP tools · subagents · skills · commands),
# which laws bind (check before run · cost honesty), where runs
# live (.nika/traces/).
#
# Cursor hook contract (docs/agent/hooks · sessionStart): input is
# JSON on STDIN; the response's "additional_context" string joins the
# session's initial context. Exit 0 always; a workspace without Nika
# gets silence ({}), never noise — and a chat without a reliable
# payload cwd stays chat_only: the hook's own process cwd is NEVER
# evidence of a project (P0-14).
#
# Two health probes ride the same seed (the kit teaches, it never
# installs):
#   · binary probe — every surface of this kit (MCP oracle · commands
#     · hooks · subagents) invokes the nika binary; without it the
#     whole kit is dead, so the seed teaches the install line in EVERY
#     workspace, nika-enabled or not. A broken install is the one
#     state where silence costs more than noise.
#   · version handshake — the kit is cut against a binary release
#     train; when the two diverge at major.minor (patch drift is
#     normal between trains) the seed names both versions and the
#     exact align command, direction-aware.
#
# The context string is STATIC — fixed content, hand-escaped once.
# The ONLY interpolated tokens are version strings sanitized to
# [0-9.] (tr -cd) and the workspace root, JSON-escaped at emission —
# so nothing user-controlled can break the JSON.

map='This workspace uses Nika (nika.sh): repeatable AI work lives in .nika workflow files, audited BEFORE they run (nika check), metered while they run, with recording enabled by default (.nika/traces/). Missing recording does not prove no effects. Laws: (1) nika check <file> must pass before any run. When the human asks you to run it, run it yourself with --max-cost-usd (announce the ceiling first); nika guard judges every run at the hook. NEVER answer a human gate for them: when a run pauses (exit 4), surface the gate'"'"'s question in the conversation verbatim, wait for their answer, then resume with --resume <trace> --answer <task>=<their answer>. (2) Cost honesty: report the output-token estimate and unpriced input billing; a local model is unpriced, never free. Already admitted calls may overshoot a metered cap. A mock model does not remove real tools or effects. (3) The boundary: an absent permits: block is ZERO authority, not a floor · any effect with no grant refuses NIKA-AUTH-006 at check. (4) Values ride three authorities · inputs (caller-supplied, and deployment-supplied via required: false + a default:) · const (baked in the file) · secrets (store references) · vars: and env: are dead envelope fields, and config: is not a field at all (NIKA-PARSE-005). Kit surfaces (availability depends on the installation): read-only MCP oracle (nika_check, nika_inspect, nika_explain, nika_schema, nika_examples, nika_template, nika_canon, nika_catalog, nika_tools) · subagents nika-author (write a workflow), nika-debugger (root-cause a run from its trace), nika-migrator (port a script) · skills nika-authoring, nika-debugging, nika-operating, nika-migration · commands check, explain, compile, trace, permits, doctor (slash-prefixed per your client). CLI: nika check|run|try|test|trace|explain|inspect|compile|catalog|doctor|welcome|wire|model|init|spec|sign|key|mcp|lsp|dap|completions. Use the relevant skill for requested repeatable workflow work, not unrelated code edits or one-off answers. Read only the references needed for the task.
